    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>I was born in 1997 in Portland, Oregon. I grew up in and around the Portland Metropolitan Area, where I graduated HS from Clackamas Middle College. I then went on to attend Corban University in Salem, studying Criminal Justice. I dropped out after my second year due to the rising cost of tuition. Now I live in Hillsboro, Oregon with my beautiful girlfriend Megan, and am currently attending Epicodus.</p>
